# First A Headline
<br>

## Add a little spacein, and a sub-title for an introduction.
| Maybe | We try |  Some  |  Mono  | Spacing |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| We can| use it| to make | a quick | table |
| and it | will help | Visualize | our data| easily |

### A Small Header to get more intimate and detailed
  
  > Then a quote block to seperate text, great for adding things as an *afterthought*, or creating a **side bar**. The quote block should wrap around to utilize available space, but I'm new so that may not be happening. Additionslly, using *Italics* and **BOLD** or even a ***Combonation*** can help link information on the page, such as referencing a table's title with the matching format to help avoid confusion.

## We go a size up for the header to introduce a new topic.

* A list of **THINGS** can help us stay organized.
  * Creating sublists is a fun way
    * To get detailed
    *  information in a
    *   compact and reader friendly way.
  * But it can be easy for
    * To lose my "Count" of
    * The spaces i use to make
      * These smaller
        * And smaller
          * And smaller
            * Sublists
  * But hopefully i can
    * Actually count
    * today
